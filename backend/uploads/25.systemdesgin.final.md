# CS 484

## Course Review & Future Prep

## Putting it all together for the "Real World"

---

# The last day of class wooo

0. FYI - I'll be at the graduation party during OH today, if you need to talk to me about anything let me know and I can stay after / we can do it quickly 
before going over to the party
1. Also FYI - MVPs are graded, feedback is in a github issue
1. High level overview of everything we've covered
  1. Please ask questions if there's parts of this that you don't understand - otherwise this might be a short class
2. "meta" concerns that I want you to take away from this class



---

# Today is NOT prep for the final exam

* The final module exam focuses on system design concerns, but builds on everything we've covered
* Today is more about providing a review and summary of topics that you can refer back to or start looking at if you end up prepping for a webdev-related interview
* Some of what I mention here won't be stuff we covered in class - but it's the type of thing you should look into if you want to deepen your skills in that area.
* Your grade in this class is temporary, your skills (and the experience you get at your first job!) are forever.

---

# **Module 1: The Web Platform**

### **HTTP: The Universal Protocol**

* **HTTP/1.1**: The foundation. Text-based, stateless, keep-alive connections.  
  * *Interview Tip*: Know **Status Codes** (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx) cold. 401 vs 403 is a common "gotcha" question.  
* **HTTP/2**: Multiplexing & more efficient framing  
  * Binary framing layer allows multiple streams over one TCP connection.  
* **HTTP/3 (QUIC)**: UDP-based.  
  * Solves TCP HOL blocking. Faster connection establishment (0-RTT).

---

# Important stuff that we covered superficially or didn't cover at all

* How Caching works at a deeper level (Cache-Control headers, ETags, etc)
* How TCP connection management, flow control, and congestion control work
* How NAT works, IPv4 vs. IPv6 (happy eyeballs), etc


---

### **The Browser**

* **The Critical Rendering Path**: HTML \-\> DOM \-\> CSSOM \-\> Render Tree \-\> Layout \-\> Paint.  
  * *Industry Reality*: "Why is my site slow?" often boils down to blocking this path. Know what "reflow" and "repaint" mean.  
* **Isolation**: The "Same Origin Policy" (SOP) is the sandbox that keeps sites separate.

---

# **Module 2: Client-Side Engineering**

### **JavaScript: The Weird Parts**

* **Event Loop**: Single-threaded concurrency.  
  * *Must Know*: The difference between **Microtasks** (Promises) and **Macrotasks** (setTimeout).  
* **Closures**: Functions retaining access to their lexical scope.

---

### **React & Modern Frameworks**

* **Virtual DOM**: React batches updates to minimize expensive real DOM paints.  
* **SSR vs CSR vs Hydration**:  
  * *Trend Alert*: **Next.js / Remix** (Server Components) are standard in 2025\. Hiring managers expect you to know *when* to render on the server vs client.  
  * *Key Concept*: "Hydration" is where the interactive JS attaches to the static HTML.

---

### **Bundling**

* **The Job**: Transpilation (TS \-\> JS), Polyfilling, Tree Shaking.  
* **Vite/Turbo**: The modern standard. Webpack is "legacy" but still powers 80% of the enterprise.
  * A lot of the skill in the web ecosystem is understanding the high level architecture, and then understanding what problem an individual tool is intended to solve and how it is doing so

---

# **Module 3: Server & Data**

### **APIs: How computers talk**

* **REST**: Resource-based (GET /users/1). Good caching, standard.  
* **GraphQL**: Query-based. Solves over/under-fetching.  
  * **Important benefit**: The shape of the returned data is well defined.
  * *Trade-off*: Caching is harder in GraphQL than REST.  
* **RPC (gRPC/tRPC)**: Action-based. High performance, tighter coupling.

---

### **Databases: Memory for your App**

* **SQL (Relational)**: Postgres, MySQL. Strict consistency (ACID).  
* **NoSQL (sometimes called document)**: MongoDB, Redis, DynamoDB.  
  * *Interview Q*: "When would you choose NoSQL over SQL?" (Answer: Flexible schema, relaxed consistency needs, massive write volume, or specific access patterns).  
* **ORMs**: Drizzle/Prisma. Beware the **N+1 problem** (fetching a list, then doing a query for each item in the list).

---

# **Module 4: Security (The "Secure" part)**

**The Golden Rule:** Never Trust User Input. Understanding what counts as user input, what counts as a user controlled computer vs. a you-controlled computer.

---

### **The Big Three Attacks**

1. **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: Attacker runs JS in user's browser.  
   * *Defense*: **CSP**, HttpOnly cookies, Framework auto-escaping.  
2. **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**: Attacker tricks browser into sending a request.  
   * *Defense*: **SameSite** cookies (Lax/Strict).  
3. **SQL Injection**: Attacker alters database queries.  
   * *Defense*: **Prepared Statements** / Parameterized Queries.
   
---

### The real world

* The right way to do things almost always exists
* But people don't realize that they did it wrong (totally reasonable! especially in big complex systems)
* Or there's a business decision to not do it right
* Or there isn't enough investment in experience for how to do it right

---

### **Authentication vs. Authorization**

* **AuthN**: Who are you? (Passwords, , Password Hashing, Passkeys).  
* **AuthZ**: What can you do? (RBAC \- Roles, OAUTH).  
* *JWTs*: Know the pros/cons of Stateless JWTs vs Stateful Session Cookies. (Hint: Revocation is hard with JWTs). We didn't cover this in much depth, but it's a common interview topic.

---

# **Module 5: Architecture & Ops**

### **Deploying Software**

* **Containers (Docker)**: "It works on my machine" \-\> It works everywhere.  
* **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration / Deployment.  
  * *Gap*: You need to know how to write a basic GitHub Action / YAML file to run tests on push.  
* **Orchestration (Kubernetes)**: Managing containers at scale.

---

### **Distributed Systems Concepts**

* **CAP Theorem**: Consistency vs Availability. Partition Tolerance is a given.  
* **Scaling**:  
  * *Vertical*: Bigger machine.  
  * *Horizontal*: More machines (Requires **Stateless** operation or very complicated coordination).

---

### **Telemetry**

* **Observability**: The "three pillars" are Logs, Metrics, and Traces.  
* **Core Web Vitals**: LCP (Loading), CLS (Visual Stability), INP (Interactivity). These affect Google Ranking.

# Special things I hope you take away from this class

* When someone asks you if something is _secure_, make sure you know what they mean
  * In general, don't be afraid to ask clarifying questions about basically anything until you fully understand what they're asking. Your job in any knowledge work is to surface the important points that are left unsaid.
* When you talk about efficiency, remember that there are lots of different types of efficiency.
  * Asymptotic runtime
  * Real-world system performance (req/sec)
  * Real world system performance per unit input (performance per watt / performance per core)
  * How much the computers cost vs. how much the engineers cost
  * How fast you can iterate on features vs. how fast your code runs
  
---

# Special things I hope you take away from this class

* If you work for a for-profit company, at a fundamental level they care about turning software engineer effort into money.
* It helps you to understand how that money is made, and whether software is a _cost_ or whether it's an _asset_.
  * Generally the _asset_ companies are better to work for, but there are plenty of well-paid jobs for people at _cost_ companies too.
* Surveillance is a fundamental aspect of how the web works today. Everything is collected, everything is measured, and everything is experimented on.

### **Good luck on the final and in your careers!**
